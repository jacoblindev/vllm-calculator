### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Composition API Pattern**: Utilized Vue 3's Composition API for better code organization and type safety
2. **Centralized State Management**: Implemented reactive state management without external dependencies
3. **Error Boundary Pattern**: Adopted React-style error boundaries adapted for Vue.js
4. **Loading State Composables**: Created reusable loading state management patterns
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built with graceful degradation for older browsers

### Error Handling Architecture

#### ErrorBoundary Component

```javascript
// Core error capture mechanism
onErrorCaptured((error, instance, info) => {
  handleError(error, { instance, info })
  return false // Prevent error propagation
})

// Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
const retry = async () => {
  const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, retryCount.value), 10000)
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay))
  // Execute retry logic
}
```

#### Loading State Management

```javascript
// Centralized loading state composable
export function useLoadingWithRetry() {
  const isLoading = ref(false)
  
  const executeWithRetry = async (operation, options = {}) => {
    isLoading.value = true
    try {
      return await operation()
    } catch (error) {
      // Retry logic with exponential backoff
    } finally {
      isLoading.value = false
    }
  }
  
  return { isLoading, executeWithRetry }
}
```
